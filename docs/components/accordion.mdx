## Accordion

This accordion component made by Galio is easily costumisable. Built with Flatlist, this expandable list can be used to only show relevant information and save space in your screen.

### Usage

Imports:

```jsx
import { Accordion, Block } from 'galio-framework';
```

Simple example:

```jsx
<Block style={{ height: 200 }}>
  <Accordion dataArray={data} />
</Block>
```

 The data array looks like:

```jsx
const data = [
  { title: "First Chapter", content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", 
    icon: {
      name: 'keyboard-arrow-up',
      family: 'material',
      size: 16,
    } 
 },
  { title: "2nd Chapter", content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" },
  { title: "3rd Chapter", content: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" }
];
```
