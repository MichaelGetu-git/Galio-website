## Icon

Icons are used as a visual indicator to describe an action the user could take. That little Facebook icon never looked better.

### Usage

Imports:

```jsx
import { Icon } from 'galio-framework';
```

Simple example:

```jsx
<Icon name="pin-3" family="Galio" color={rgb(100,120,40)} size={10} />
```

### Props

|------------|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **name**   | string | null                 | Choose your Icon's name from Expo's icon list.                              |
| **family** | string | null                 | Choose your Icon's family from the same list.                               |

| **color**  | string | `theme.COLORS.BLACK` | This sets your Icon's color.                                                |

We're grateful to use the icon sets from **react-native-vector-icons**.
