## Slider

We all need a slider in our application. This is a JavaScript component built with the PanResponder and Animated APIs.

### Usage

Imports:

```jsx
import { Slider, Block } from 'galio-framework';
```

Simple example:

    value={10}
    onSlidingcomplete={() => this.registerTheValue()}
  />
</Block>
```
